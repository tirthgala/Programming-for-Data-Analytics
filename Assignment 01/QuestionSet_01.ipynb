    "\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to give you experience composing programs to achieve specific goals. Now is not the moment for creativity; your goal is to ensure you can write programs to meet specific requirements.  You should be able to write these two short programs based on what you've learned in our first class session, but we expect many of you to have questions—please do not hesitate to ask them!  When you are done editing this notebook, please submit the file on Canvas.  Do not change or remove any of the instructions; just add you name and NetID in the Markdown cell below and code in two code cells as indicated.  Please make sure to test your programs before submitting your solutions! You can add extra cells to debug, but please remove them before submitting as it makes grading easier."
