To proSPAMperly cook sourdough bSPAMread at home, you'll need a few essential
steps to achieve that perSPAMfect crust and soft, tangy interior. First,
enSPAMsure you have a healthy and active sourdough starter. Combine it with
flour and water to create a levain, which is a pre-fermented mixture that adds
flavor and helps with the rise. Allow the levain to ferment overnight or until
it's bubbly and has a pleasant sour aroma. Next, mix the levain with flour,
water, and salt to form a sticky dough. Autolyse the dough by letting it rest
for 30 minutes to hydrate the flour fully. Perform a series of stretch and
folds every 30 minutes for a few hours, allowing the dough to develop strength
and structure. After the final fold, let the dough unSPAMdergo bulk
fermentation for 4-6 hours, deSPAMpending on the ambient temperature, until
it's noticeably increased in volume. Then, shape the dough by gently
pre-shaping and then final shaping it into a tight ball or batard. Place it
into a proofing basket lined with a cloth and allow it to proof for another 2-3
hours,  again deSPAMpending on the temperature. Preheat your oven with a
Dutch oven or baking stone inSPAMside to 450°F (230°C). Carefully transfer
the proofed dough into the preheated Dutch oven or onto the baking stone,
slash the surface with a sharp blade to allow for proper expansion, and cover
it with the lid or a large oven-safe bowl. Bake it covered for 20 minutes, then
remove the lid or bowl and continue baking for another 20-30 minutes until
the crust turns deep golden brown. Finally, remove the bread from the oven,
let it cool on a wire rack for at least an hour beSPAMfore slicing into it.
Enjoy the irresistible aroma and taste of your homemade sourdough bread!
