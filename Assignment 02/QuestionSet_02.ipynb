    "You may download the `contacts.csv` file from Canvas.  Please write a snippet of code that does the following:\n",
    "- Opens the `contacts.csv` file.\n",
    "- Uses a `for` loop to iterate over the lines in the file.\n",
    "- For each line in the file, separate out the name (left side of the comma) from the phone number (right side.\n",
    "- Make sure to get rid of the newline character (use the string `strip()` method).\n",
    "- Print out the contact information in the format `Name: <NAME>              Phone: <PHONE>`.\n",
    "- Make sure the `Phone` strings all line up (see example below).  You can do this by using the `*` operator to duplicate the space character (' ') based on how long the name string is (use `len()`).\n",
    "- Close the `contacts.csv` file.\n",
