    "## Part 1: Employee Bonus Calculator\n",
    "Create a program that calculates the bonus amount for employees based on their performance rating and years of service. Design a function that takes the performance rating and years of service as inputs and returns the bonus amount. Consider the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the performance rating is \"Excellent\" and years of service are greater than or equal to 5, the bonus amount is \\$10,000.\n",
    "- If the performance rating is \"Good\" or \"Excellent\" and years of service are greater than or equal to 3, the bonus amount is \\$5,000.\n",
    "- For any other combination of performance rating and years of service, the bonus amount is \\$2,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have written this function, write some additional code to read in the file `employees.csv` and calculate the bonus for each employee.  The `employees.csv` file has one employee per line and a header line that describes each of the columns; the first five lines of the file are as follows.\n",
